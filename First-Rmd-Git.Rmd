require(tidyverse)

## R Markdown

This is an RMD file altered by Oliver Souliere

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mpg}
a <- 88
b <- 99
c <- a+b
print(c)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r avgmpg}
avgmpgdata <- mpg %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarize(hwy = mean(hwy), cty = mean(cty))

g <- ggplot(data = avgmpgdata)
g + geom_col(aes(x = hwy, y = reorder(manufacturer, hwy), fill = manufacturer)) +
  ggtitle("Average Miles per Gallon for Highway Driving by Manufacturer", subtitle = "Data on vehicles from 1999 to 2008 for 38 popular models of cars") +
  theme(legend.position="none") 
```
